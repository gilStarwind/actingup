# Acting Up Website (React)

This workspace now contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold using your converted JSX.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
- I converted the React code that was inside `index.html` into `src/App.jsx` and created `src/main.jsx`.
- If you want TailwindCSS, I can add it next (requires config and installs).
- Run `npm install` to fetch dependencies and start the dev server.
